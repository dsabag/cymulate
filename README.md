sendInBlue sdk wont let me keep api tokens in github so im posting it here...

please update the "apiKey.apiKey" value in line 13 on server/controllers/mailController.js 

the key is:
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


this took an overall 3:20 

didn't have time to schema validate data or even take out "mailer" component out of "sign in"

hope you like it
